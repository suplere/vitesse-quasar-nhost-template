## Backend Features

For backend I will use [Nhost](http://nhost.io) features:

- Database
- GraphQL
- Auth
- Storage
- Serverless Function

## Usage

### Development

Prepare local backend with [nhost-cli](https://github.com/nhost/cli). Please instal cli as described [here](https://github.com/nhost/cli#installation). Then move to the nhost-demo-template folder

[Onesignal](https://app.onesignal.com/) integration - Create on the Onesignal web new Web Application, with origin http://localhost:4010. Then fill this env variables in the nhost-demo-template folder - in the file .env.development

```
APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4010
ONE_SIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=your rest api key from Onesignal web
ONE_SIGNAL_APP_ID=your APP_ID from Onesignal web
```

```bash
cd nhost-demo-template
nhost up
```

You may see Hasura Console here: http://localhost:1337

[Onesignal](https://app.onesignal.com/) integration - If you want use Onesignal you need add these variables to the .env.development file in the frontend folder.
```
VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=the same as ONE_SIGNAL_APP_ID above
VITE_ONESIGNAL_LOCALHOST=true
```

Then you may run

```bash
cd frontend
npx vite --port=4010
```

Just run and visit http://localhost:4010

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

### Deploy on Netlify

Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and select your clone, `OK` along the way, and your App will be live in a minute. Don't forget use frontend folder as root folder.
Please do not forget set this ENV variables on the Netlify site:

```
VITE_FRONTEND_URL - front end URL address ( without / at the end)
VITE_NHOST_REGION - region from your Nhost app
VITE_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN - subdomain from your Nhost app
```

If you want use OnseSignal integration, you must register new application on the Onesignal web, for your netlify URL origin }or some custom domain).

Then you need add this ENV variable:
```
VITE_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID - App id of the new web on one signal. Will be different from local dev.
```

## Why

I have been using Hasura GraphQL Engine as a backend for my projects for a long time. Now, after a long time, I found the [Nhost](http://nhost.io) cloud solution and I have to say that, except for a few minor things (e.g. email templates only in the paid version), this product suits me.

In the same way, I used the Vitesse template for my projects, so I decided to extend it with [Nhost Serverless Functions](https://docs.nhost.io/platform/serverless-functions). In my opinion, it is a combination of some of the best things available now.

It is a complex solution and I will be happy if this template contributes to the expansion of already published examples and templates.
